          After ratifying the ECHR in 1953 Happyland continued to molest thousands of children, young women and an entire native community.
          Happyland was never held responsible before an international court, and in 2008 Happyland was ranked The Happiest People in the World.

            <h3>Upbringing</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in a state orphanage, and while I was beaten and humiliated, and while dreams and hopes were crushed, 
              I have been able to shift my perspective from that of a victim to that of a witness.
              The mental landscape that takes shape during childhood does not change much over the course of life. Mine was a "living hell," 
              although I did find a "piece of heaven" in America. So while I have memories of light, 
              many of those I grew up with never found a way out of the darkness.

            <h3>Belonging</h3>
            <p>
              My brother was a quiet kid, and my parents were sweet but weak. After the state intervention in 1965, my parents were heavily medicated. 
              It wasn't until his mid-twenties that my brother started down a self-destructive route. He turned the unbearable pain inward and suffered irreparable damage. 
              Seeing my family slowly but surely destroyed under the choking control of ignorant and arrogant bureaucrats is the fuel that drives my wish for some kind of justice.
